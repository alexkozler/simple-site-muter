**Simple Site Muter**

https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/simple-site-muter/

Chrome-like site muting extension for Firefox. Adds a context-menu to tabs to mute/unmute entire sites by domain name (ignoring subdomains and paths).
Effectively just auto-mutes blacklisted tabs. You can still manually unmute a blacklisted tab the normal way, and new instances of said site will still be auto-muted.
Unmute with the same context-menu button to remove from the blacklist.

No fancy UI, no network calls, remembers your choices between browser restarts.
